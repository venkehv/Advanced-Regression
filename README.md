# Project Name
Predicting the price of a house in Australian market for Surprise Housing company. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price.


## Conclusions
The optimal lambda value in case of Ridge and Lasso is as below:

Ridge : 0.0001
Lasso : 0.0001
Mean Squared error in case of Ridge and Lasso are:

Ridge : 0.01664
Lasso : 0.01661
R2 Score are:

Ridge : Train - 89.3 / Test - 88.8
Lasso : Train - 89.3 / Test - 88.8
The lambda, Mean Squared error and R2 score is same in both Ridge and Lasso Regression. Since Lasso helps in feature reduction (as the coefficient value of one of the feature became 0), Lasso has a better edge over Ridge.

Hence based on Lasso, the factors that generally affect the house price are the -

Living area square feet,
Zoning classification,
Garage area,
Fireplace quality,
Kitchen quality and
Basement quality along with the Basement finished square feet area
